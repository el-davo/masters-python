How does the tool support watching files?
--------------------------------------------------------
To get the tool to watch files we will use a cronjob that runs every minute. I have provided a bash script to create the cron task.
To use the script run the following cmd.

./crontab.sh

This will create a new cronjob that runs every minute and will point to the relevant files needed to run the python script.
As a pre-requisite make sure you have installed python 3 and python is available on the command line. For example if you run
the command below you should see the python version number

./python3 --version


How does the tool backup files?
--------------------------------------------------------
The tool will read from the config.dat unless told otherwise. You can choose your own configuration file using the command below.

./timemachine --config=path/to/config

The tool will read all the lines in the provided config.dat file and these lines will represent a path to a file on disk.
The tool tool will take a current backup of each file on first run. The backups will be stored in a folder named as a hash of the path.
The current timestamp will be stored on the root hash folder in a file called - last-modification-date.txt
If the file has been modified between runs then the tool will backup the new version under a new timestamp folder in the hash path
and will update the latest timestamp in last-modification-date.txt.

I used the hashlib library in python to create a hash of the filepath using sha224. This seemed like a good idea as it generated
a unique folder name per file that does not change. And sha224 seems robust enough to not have any collisions in folder names


How can I list the files in config.dat?
--------------------------------------------------------
You can use the command below

./timemachine --list

This will list the files in the config.dat file. Alternatively you can also give a path the another config file and the tool will list
the contents of that file. To do this use the command below

./timemachine --list --config=/path/to/custom/config


How can I add a new file to config.dat?
--------------------------------------------------------
You can use the command below

./timemachine --add=path/to/file

The tool will first check if the file exists. If it does not then the tool will alert the user and will not store the file.
If however the file does exist then the new file will be added and the user will be alerted.
You can optionally give the path to another config file and the tool will add your new file to be watched in there.
Use the command below to achieve this

./timemachine --add=path/to/file --config=/path/to/custom/config


How can I remove a file from config.dat?
--------------------------------------------------------
You can use the command below

./timemachine --remove=path/to/file

The tool will delete the specified file only if it exists in the config.dat file or the optional config file.
If it does not exit then the user will be alerted. If it does exist it will be removed and the user will be informed
of the removal. You can pass in an optional config file using the command below

./timemachine --remove=path/to/file --config=/path/to/custom/config


How am I parsing arguments?
--------------------------------------------------------
I am using a library called parseargs. This lib is essential when dealing with command line arguments. It makes it very
easy to deal with all kinds of command line arguments in a few lines of code.
